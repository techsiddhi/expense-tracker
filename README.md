# ðŸ’¸ Expense Tracker

Hey! So this is a super simple expense tracker I made using **Flask** and **SQLite**.  
You can add your daily expenses, view them in a table, delete them if needed, and see how much youâ€™ve spent in total. Thatâ€™s pretty much it.

The design is plain and minimal â€” nothing too fancy.

## ðŸ§¾ Features

- Add expenses (amount, category, date, and note)
- View all your expenses in a table
- Delete any entry

## ðŸ§° Stuff I Used

- **Flask (Python)** â€“ backend  
- **HTML + CSS** â€“ basic frontend  
- **SQLite** â€“ to store the data  
- *(No JavaScript yet, but might add later)*
